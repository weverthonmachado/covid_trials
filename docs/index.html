The intervention components are: identifying patient goals with therapist (1:1); and participation in virtual groups (up to 4 participants per session) with physiotherapist and occupational therapists which focus on increasing participation in life roles and usual activities. &lt;br&gt;The 1:1 session will last for approximately 45 minutes and will be followed by commencement of group sessions within 5 days.&lt;br&gt;Groups adopt a coaching model where the therapist talks about common challenges, facilitates discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas and the group brainstorm and plan next steps together.

Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed. Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team. Blood samples will be transported to Queensland Pathology on the Herston Campus for drug analysis. Prescribing of initial and ongoing/revised dosing will remain the responsibility of medical officers, whilst fidelity of the intervention will be maintained through pharmacy dosing adjustment notes which are subjected to","Experimental group:WeChat-based parenting education;Control groop:Electronic Manual + Teaching Plan;","COVID-19 symptomatic confirmed hospitalized adult patients will be enrolled as soon as possible after fulfilling the criteria for randomisation.

The Decathlon mask will be applied by clinicians in the hospital setting.&lt;br&gt;The mask is worn over the entire face and has advantages over conventional delivery methods in that it is thought to reduce the risk of virus aerosolization (a common problem with conventional delivery systems) and therefore increase safety for healthcare workers and other patients at the hospital.&lt;br&gt;We will test mask comfort and tolerability with daily questionnaires.&lt;br&gt;The mask will be applied to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during transfer between the emergency department and other locations such as radiology department, ward and high dependency unit.&lt;br&gt;We anticipate the mask will be worn for several hours at a time depending on patient tolerability (early data from overseas suggests superior tolerability to conventional mask setups).  The mask may be used intermittently for the entire patient admission to hospital pending the clinical needs and preference of the patient. We anticipate, based on how conventional treatments are applied, that the patient will use the mask in 3 hour sessions with potential breaks in between to be determined by clinical need and patient tolerability.","control group:General basic epidemic prevention measures;sachet group:General basic epidemic prevention measures + Traditional Chinese medicine sachet;Oral and nasal spray group:General basic epidemic prevention measures + Oral and nasal spray;Oral Chinese medicine group:General basic epidemic prevention measures + Traditional Chinese medicine for epidemic prevention in high risk groups;","experimental group:Chinese herbal tea;control group:drinking water;","Intervention is an aqueous buffered solution of 0.5% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) contained in a 30 mL bottle closed with a traditional nasal spray pump.&lt;br&gt;Subjects will receive a single dose to their nasal passages, administered by the investigator. &lt;br&gt;The amount a subject receives consists of 6 x 140µL pump actuations (3 into each nostril), being 0.84 mL total volume.","In-hospital rehabilitation group: A. the patients took Qigong lung-nourishing exercise twice a day, once in the morning and afternoon, about 15 minutes each time.

This non-invasive device provides a physical barrier to droplet and aerosol spread, as well as utilising a ventilation system to reduce aerosol spread from COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.  The hood has a skirt that drapes down the sides of the bed and over the patients waist and does not seal around the patient. The hood relies upon air being drawn up the sides of the bed and from the front near the patient’s legs etc. up to the rear, i.e. away from the healthcare worker who is principally at the front/sides of the patient. The air passes through the fan and on through a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, thereafter returning to the hospital air environment.  The device will be used continuously for 7 days or until the patient has been declared COVID-19 negative, is discharged from hospital, or elects to withdraw from the study.  Use of the device is entirely voluntary, and patients may elect to cease use of the device at any time either temporarily, or permanently.  Staff will be asked to complete simple data for each clinical shift about device compliance use.  In addition, measures to capture technical product adverse events and complaints will be captured by forms available to clinical staff and checked daily by the investigator team.

The seven modules are: (1) identifying and rating emotions, (2) relaxation, (3) self-compassion, (4) gratitude, (5) staying connected, (6) physical care, and (7) goal setting. The app uses short videos and interactive activities to allow participants to practice the coping strategies that are taught in each module (e.g. a relaxation technique). Participants are asked to complete one module per day and to complete the modules in one week. Each module takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will be asked to complete module 1 first, but the other modules can be completed in any order. Adherence will be assessed via app analytics and also using self-report.","Drug: Tociliuzumab","Biological: Blood plasma","&lt;br&gt;                The study consists of the following periods/assessments for participants in both the intervention and control arms.&lt;br&gt;                1.

includes a smartphone app and a pulse oximeter that measures oxygen saturation, pulse rate and collects symptoms. &lt;br&gt;Patients place their index finger in the pulse oximeter to measure their oxygen saturation and pulse rate twice a day, which will take approximately 5 minutes each time. Patients then enter the results into the TCC-COVID app twice daily, and complete a symptom questionnaire via the TCC-COVID app once daily, which will take approximately 5 minutes. The symptom questionnaire was designed specifically for this study. The measurements and information are directly connected to a clinician interface (KIOLA database) which provides the data of all patients in aggregate and an easy to use responsive format with customisable alerts. The alerts identify if the oxygen saturation levels are low or the pulse rate is out of range. The alerts also identify if a measurement has not been completed in a timely manner and the central monitoring service will contact the patient to check on their safety or if they are experiencing any technical issues. The overall duration of participation will be 14 days.","Other: Telemedicine;Other: Standard care","Behavioral: Coping strategies video","&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Masitinib&lt;br&gt;Product Code:

07/05/2020:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                RECOVERY is a randomised trial among people hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible patients are randomly allocated between several treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital: No additional treatment vs lopinavir + ritonavir vs corticosteroids vs hydroxychloroquine vs azithromycin. The study allows a second randomisation for patients with progressive COVID-19 (evidence of hypoxia and a hyper-inflammatory state): No additional treatment vs Tocilizumab. For patients for whom not all the trial arms are appropriate or at locations where not all are available, randomisation will be between fewer arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                RECOVERY has an adaptive trial design. The interim trial results will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC will assess whether the randomised comparisons in the study have provided evidence on mortality that is strong enough (with a range of uncertainty around the results that is narrow enough) to affect national and global treatment strategies. In such a circumstance, the DMC will inform the Trial Steering Committee who will make the results available to the public and amend the trial arms accordingly. New trial arms can be added as evidence emerges that other candidate therapeutics should be evaluated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Drug dosage and duration&lt;br&gt;                First (main) randomisation:&lt;br&gt;                1.

It was adapted from HeadGear, an existing smartphone application designed for individuals working in male-dominated industries. Anchored is more broadly aimed at all adults, and has a more gender-neutral look and feel, achieved through use of colour scheme, imagery, font/typography, inclusion of male and female ‘characters’, and delivery of in-app content by both male and female presenters. The Anchored app is designed for self-directed use by an individual on a smartphone device. It features interactive content, delivered by on-screen text, audio, static and interactive image displays and videos. The app can be accessed by the participant on their smartphone at a time and location of their choosing. This app/intervention has been used previously in a pilot study: Pilot-testing of a mobile phone application to support the mental health of Australian workers (ACTRN12619000761167); and is being currently being evaluated in a large scale randomised controlled trial (ACTRN12620000178943). Due to the unexpected changes to the workforce brought about by COVID-19 (coronavirus) the present study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the Anchored app in individuals who are unemployed as a consequence of COVID-19. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main therapeutic component of the Anchored app takes the form of a 30 day intervention in which users complete one ‘challenge’ daily (5- 10 minutes per day).

In response to the latest developments with regards to the coronavirus outbreak, the app will contain a dedicated session providing guidance for junior doctors who have pandemic-related anxieties and concerns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shift app's conceptual design was modelled after HeadGear, an evidence-informed app delivered by the Black Dog Institute that has been shown to alleviate mental health concerns in working populations (Deady et al., 2018). The prototype and the current version of the Shift app have been adjusted in close collaboration with medical doctors, NSW Health, external digital project designers, and in-house IT developers, user experience, digital learning, and marketing and communication experts within the Black Dog Institute. Initial pilot testing of the Shift app prototype [approved by the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District HREC protocol number 2019/ETH00318, N = 22] resulted in design, content, and user experience updates of the app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shift is a smartphone application compatible with Apple and Android operating systems. Shift delivers its contents through text, audio, and video addressing topics such as depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, burnout, alcohol and drug use, sleep health, shift work, exams and interviews, work/life balance, diet, exercise, rural and regional placements, bullying, grief, calling for a consult, feeling inadequate, and anxieties related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Adult ICU patients with serious/life-threatening COVID-19 receiving standard empiric therapies as per institutional and international protocols such as available antiviral treatments, hydroxychloroquine, mechanical (ARDS-net and prone position) ventilation,  fluid resuscitation, vasoactive substances, antibiotics amongst other usual ICU supportive therapies will be randomised to control or TPE groups. Those in the control group will receive usual care. Those in the TPE group will receive usual care plus TPE therapy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Randomization of the aforementioned groups will be done as follows. Eligible consented patients will be randomized after their stratification by ICU center and two PaO2/FIO2 ratio categories (&gt;150 and &lt;=150). Randomization will occur in variable block sizes of 4 to 8 patients. The researchers will utilize a web-based randomization service (randomize.net) to allocate patients to their respective strata prior to the intervention or control therapy. Given the nature of the TPE technology, the intervention will be unblinded (open label); hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited.
