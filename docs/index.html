Prior to attending they will have received written information about the study and had time to consider it. At the screening visit a doctor will explain about the study and answer any questions they may have. If the volunteer decides to take part, they will be asked to sign a consent form. The doctor will then check whether the volunteer is eligible to take part. This will involve taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, taking blood tests, urine tests, and measuring blood pressure and temperature.&lt;br&gt;                The doctor will then write to the volunteers own GP to enquire about their medical health. If all the inclusion criteria are met and none of the exclusion criteria are present then the volunteer is invited to return for vaccination.

Participants will receive their usual management and information will be collected subsequently, detailing their treatment and outcomes. Research participants will not be contacted directly and no personally identifiable information (names, addresses or dates of birth will be collected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Cohort identification:&lt;br&gt;                Infected women will be identified through the UKOSS network of nominated reporting clinicians in each consultant-led maternity unit in the UK. Nominated reporting clinicians will be asked to report all pregnant women with confirmed pandemic novel coronavirus infection admitted to their unit. In view of the need for rapid and ongoing data analysis and production of guidance, we will use a specific web-based rapid reporting and data collection system for this study to enable UKOSS nominated clinicians to report cases as they occur. In addition, nominated clinicians will be sent a standard UKOSS reporting card each month to further enhance case ascertainment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Comparison group identification:&lt;br&gt;                Information about comparison women will be obtained from previously conducted UKOSS studies.

However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy.

Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team. Blood samples will be transported to Queensland Pathology on the Herston Campus for drug analysis.

A printed version of this leaflet has been used in previous treatment studies conducted by our research group. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                The duration of treatment will be one week and the follow-up period is at the end of the treatment period. Participants will be randomised using online software (where good sleepers will be randomised to treatment or no treatment).&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Remdesivir&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Lyophilisate for solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: REMDESIVIR&lt;br&gt;Current Sponsor code: REMDESIVIR&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: REMDESIVIR&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 100-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Chloroquine&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Tablet&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Chloroquine&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 54-05-7&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 250-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: &lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 747-36-4&lt;br&gt;Current Sponsor code: HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 200-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Lopinavir/Ritonavir&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: &lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: LOPINAVIR&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 192725-17-0&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 200-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: InterferÃ³n b 1A&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: &lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Interferon beta-1a&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 220581-49-7&lt;br&gt;Current Sponsor code: Interferon beta-1a&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: Interferon beta-1a&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: g gram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 152-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: DEFITELIO&lt;br&gt;Product Name: DEFITELIO&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: DEFIBROTIDE&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 83712-60-1&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg/kg milligram(s)/kilogram&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 25-&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;Route of administration of the placebo: Intravenous use&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;                Patients presenting to the UZH COVID-19 Testing Center for SARS-CoV-2 testing will be enrolled in the cohort study. All patients will undergo routine testing at the testing center. The cohort study-specific follow-up and prospective data collection will depend on the test result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will receive three calls at 7, 14 and 60 days after their visit to the testing center. Information will be collected about the disease course and current health status, as well as further health care contacts. Further information about the disease course, hospitalization and patient outcomes will be collected from patient records obtained from general practitioners and treating physicians in hospitals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 will receive one call at 14 days after their visit to the testing center. Information will be collected about the disease course and current health status, as well as further health care contacts and retesting. If retested, further information about the second test result will be collected from general practitioners and treating physicians in hospitals. Biological samples obtained for viral testing will additionally be analyzed for further respiratory pathogens.&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;                The trial will initially be two-arm, comparing usual care to usual care with hydroxychloroquine treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                The trial will be implemented in the first instance in practices that are already part of the RCGP RSC Network. Currently, over 500 practices are part of this network, with 100 already offering a sentinel viral swabbing service which is being scaled up and due to the pandemic, all practices in the UK have been asked to join the RCGP RSC Network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                A platform trial, in contrast to say a  traditional two-arm design, allows multiple arms to be considered simultaneously, and interventions can be dropped and replaced as evidence emerges for effectiveness or lack of it. The intent is to establish an on-going trial infrastructure within a master protocol that uses all the data already accumulated for the assessment of current and subsequently introduced interventions. New interventions will only be added after submission to the appropriate approval bodies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                The PRINCIPLE trial will begin as a 1:1 randomised trial of usual care plus study-specific medication (in the first instance hydroxychloroquine) versus usual care alone but the study design has the capability to add additional interventions over time. The evaluation of any new interventions will be governed by the master protocol, including adaptive and decision criteria. In addition, the inclusion of any new interventions will require supplementary appendices to the protocol and SAP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                The initial drug is hydroxychloroquine sulphate 200 mg tablets.
