It is expected that this study will not require individual patient consent. This study is in effect a large-scale clinical audit during a global health emergency, as all data is already recorded as part of routine clinical care, therefore justifying participant enrolment using a waiver of consent. Retrospective data will be sourced from all collaborating hospitals across Australia from January 2020 to March 2020. Whereas, international hospitals will provide their retrospective data between January 2019 and march 2020.

The intervention consists of a rehabilitation intervention which focuses more on participation in usual activities and is offered via a coaching model to a virtual group of people. The intervention components are: identifying patient goals with therapist (1:1); and participation in virtual groups (up to 4 participants per session) with physiotherapist and occupational therapists which focus on increasing participation in life roles and usual activities. &lt;br&gt;The 1:1 session will last for approximately 45 minutes and will be followed by commencement of group sessions within 5 days.&lt;br&gt;Groups adopt a coaching model where the therapist talks about common challenges, facilitates discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas and the group brainstorm and plan next steps together. The group sessions will last approximately 45 minutes and will be delivered 3 times per week for up to 4 weeks. &lt;br&gt;Adherence will be measured using attendance logs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;",null,"Patients with pulmonary infection and COVID 19 will have their respiratory management during ICU admission decided in one of two ways&lt;br&gt;Method 1.

The treatment will be different in every patient. Depending on the results of the auscultation and waveform analysis, a different method of mechanical ventilation or respiratory physiotherapy may be chosen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Respiratory physiotherapy may be different in each case but will consist of either ventilator hyperinflation, positioning or manual techniques. The senior respiratory physiotherapist will decide the type of physiotherapy treatment delivered based on COVI 19 guidelines. &lt;br&gt;This will be from admission to ICU to 28 days post hospital discharge","Drug: Piclidenoson","Exposure to COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participant involvement is required, including but not limited to extra nasopharyngeal swabs, blood draws, as well as possible surveys (local site intervention is bound to ISARIC protocol).&lt;br&gt;There may be follow-up after discharge, at 3 and 6 month timepoints (protocol is evolving).","Based on preclinical and non-randomised studies, the Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital Intensive Care Unit clinical Consultant Medical Staff, in agreement with the Infectious Diseases Department and the Pharmacy Department, have decided that all patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 infection should receive hydroxychloroquine as standard care. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed. Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team. Blood samples will be transported to Queensland Pathology on the Herston Campus for drug analysis. Prescribing of initial and ongoing/revised dosing will remain the responsibility of medical officers, whilst fidelity of the intervention will be maintained through pharmacy dosing adjustment notes which are subjected to","All women infected with SARS-CoV 2 (novel coronavirus) infection or who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy. Observation will continue throughout pregnancy up until 6 weeks postpartum. In addition to standard care, women will be asked to complete a questionnaire after discharge to include postpartum and neonatal outcomes.","Drug: Defibrotide Injection","Expressive/gratitude writing intervention â€“ This group will participate in the adapted evidenced-based 4-day writing program (Pennebaker 1997). Participants will meet with the facilitator (a researcher with a Psychology degree) using Zoom in a group format four times in one week for approx. 30 minutes (25 minutes of writing time). Daily e-mail reminders will be sent during the 4 days of writing. Session structure â€“ 1 min to complete the distress VAS measure (before), 5 minutes write any reflection from last session, 15 minutes spent writing about your thoughts and feelings, 5 minutes writing about the things you are grateful for, 1 min to complete the distress VAS measure (after). The instruction each day will be (adapted from Pennebaker): &lt;br&gt;â€œPlease write about your thoughts and feelings about your IBD and the recent situation with COVID-19. Try to select something that you had a strong reaction to â€“ perhaps this was a thought that was challenging or unpleasant. Feel free to really let go and explore your very deepest emotions and thoughts. You might tie your topic to your relationships with others, including parents, lovers, friends or relatives, to your past, your present, your future, or to who you have been, who you would like to be, or who you are now. All of your writing will be completely confidential. Please donâ€™t worry about spelling, sentence structure, or grammar.

The mask may be used intermittently for the entire patient admission to hospital pending the clinical needs and preference of the patient. We anticipate, based on how conventional treatments are applied, that the patient will use the mask in 3 hour sessions with potential breaks in between to be determined by clinical need and patient tolerability.","This is designed as a cross-sectional, community-based observational study assessing the impact of social isolation on mental health (depression, anxiety, insomnia) during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;br&gt;The duration of the study is one month.&lt;br&gt;The duration of observation in each participant will be single 15 min assessment","experimental group:Chinese herbal tea;control group:drinking water;","Case series:mesenchymal stem cells therapy;","Intervention is an aqueous buffered solution of 0.5% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) contained in a 30 mL bottle closed with a traditional nasal spray pump.&lt;br&gt;Subjects will receive a single dose to their nasal passages, administered by the investigator. &lt;br&gt;The amount a subject receives consists of 6 x 140ÂµL pump actuations (3 into each nostril), being 0.84 mL total volume.","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Antimicrobial therapy (antibiotics)&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","Case series:Nil;","Case series:Subcutaneous injection of thymosin a1, take Ma-Xing-Shi-Gan tang and Yin-Qiao powder plus or minus;","In-hospital rehabilitation group: A. the patients took Qigong lung-nourishing exercise twice a day, once in the morning and afternoon, about 15 minutes each time.

This swab is not used for clinical diagnosis and is only used for validation of the antigen test.","Intervention 1: Questionnaire survey of general practitioners with panel practice Method: Based on semi-structured guideline interviews with general practitioners, nine subject areas were identified. Based on this structure a questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire contains items that are only given once (e.g. items relating to the beginning of the pandemic) and items that can be given weekly. This questionnaire was checked for comprehensibility by 3 - 5 family doctors. The recruitment of the participants is carried out via the email distribution list of professional associations and existing family doctor research and teaching networks. The survey is conducted via the open source online tool LimeSurvey. Persons who have agreed to participate in a weekly survey in the first survey will be contacted weekly. Since each participant chooses a code that only he/she knows, it is possible to summarize the surveys belonging to one person longitudinally, but it is not possible to assign these answers to a specific person. This guarantees the anonymity of the respondents. &lt;br&gt;Evaluation: The questionnaire is evaluated descriptively. Primarily, the extent of existing deficiencies and problems is to be recognized. Therefore, the items are evaluated individually and no summary of the items is planned. For this reason, the answers are displayed in frequencies. In order to obtain a conclusion on the population, 95% confidence intervals are calculated for the frequencies. Possible group differences (e.g. ordination in the country vs. ordination in the city) are analysed exploratively by means of chi-square methods. The sample size results from the e-mail addresses available in the distribution lists.","Intervention 1: An interview will be conducted with patients who are undergoing (partial) inpatient or day-care psychosomatic treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic for mental or psychosomatic diseases, as well as with employees of the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine of the University Hospital of Freiburg who have patient contact during the pandemic (with or without COVID-19 infection), and with employees of the University Hospital of Freiburg who are working on so-called COVID-19 wards during the pandemic.","Intervention 1: This study has two phases.

The group will allow members to receive information and contribute to weekly conversations on pre-specified topics related to physical activity eg. sedentary behaviour, goal setting, benefits of physical activity and support. Different topics will be covered each week with 2-3 Facebook posts on the topic each week. The content of each topic is designed specifically for this study but will also make use of existing videos, pictures and information sources. An exercise physiologists and dietitian will deliver the program. The purpose of the Facebook group is to facilitate social support and provide participants with a platform to exchange personal experiences including barriers and facilitators to commencing and maintaining a physical activity program. While discussion topics will be pre-determined, discussion will change weekly based on the participants posts for example someone may ask for examples of workouts or different ways overcome barriers. Participants will also be able to join a group video call via zoom two times per week. These calls will last for 20-30mins. The facilitator will lead the call and provide education on the topic for the week. This will also give the facilitator the chance to check in on participants and allow them to ask questions.

The seven modules are: (1) identifying and rating emotions, (2) relaxation, (3) self-compassion, (4) gratitude, (5) staying connected, (6) physical care, and (7) goal setting. The app uses short videos and interactive activities to allow participants to practice the coping strategies that are taught in each module (e.g. a relaxation technique). Participants are asked to complete one module per day and to complete the modules in one week. Each module takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will be asked to complete module 1 first, but the other modules can be completed in any order.

This non-invasive device provides a physical barrier to droplet and aerosol spread, as well as utilising a ventilation system to reduce aerosol spread from COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.  The hood has a skirt that drapes down the sides of the bed and over the patients waist and does not seal around the patient. The hood relies upon air being drawn up the sides of the bed and from the front near the patient’s legs etc. up to the rear, i.e. away from the healthcare worker who is principally at the front/sides of the patient. The air passes through the fan and on through a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, thereafter returning to the hospital air environment.  The device will be used continuously for 7 days or until the patient has been declared COVID-19 negative, is discharged from hospital, or elects to withdraw from the study.  Use of the device is entirely voluntary, and patients may elect to cease use of the device at any time either temporarily, or permanently.  Staff will be asked to complete simple data for each clinical shift about device compliance use.  In addition, measures to capture technical product adverse events and complaints will be captured by forms available to clinical staff and checked daily by the investigator team.  Technical product complaint data will be submitted to an independent data safety monitor team.","experimental group:Xiangsha Liujun Pill;Control group:Placebo;","Experimental group:Shumian capsule;Control group:Shumian capsule placebo;","HDIVC group:100mg/kg/day;Control group:normal saline;","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Resochin &lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Tablet&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Chloroquine&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: CHLOROQUINE PHOSPHATE&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 250-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Quensyl&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Tablet&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Hydroxychloroquine&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 747-36-4&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 200-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Kaletra&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Tablet&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: LOPINAVIR&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 192725-17-0&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 200-&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: RITONAVIR&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 155213-67-5&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 50-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Xarelto&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Tablet&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: RIVAROXABAN&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 366789-02-8&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 10-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Tablet&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Candesartan&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: CANDESARTAN CILEXETIL&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 4-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","Case series:wearing medical mask after extubation in PACU;","Case series:N/A;","Control  group:xiaoyao capsule;Experimental group:xiaoyao capsule;","&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2&lt;br&gt;Product Code: APN01&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: APN01 / GSK2586881&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: GSK2586881&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg/ml milligram(s)/millilitre&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 5-&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;Route of administration of the placebo: Intravenous use&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","ECMO group:ECMO;mechanic ventilation:mechanic ventilation;",null,"Experimental group:Narrative therapy;Experimental group:Group psychological counseling;","Three conditions are tested (each lasting 30 min, the â€˜measurement periodâ€™): &lt;br&gt;1.

New trial arms can be added as evidence emerges that other candidate therapeutics should be evaluated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Eligible patients are randomly allocated between several treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital: No additional treatment vs Lopinavir-Ritonavir vs Interferon 1ÃŸ vs Low-dose Corticosteroids vs Hydroxychloroquine.&lt;br&gt;                For patients for whom not all the trial arms are appropriate or at locations where not all are available, randomisation will be between fewer arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Drug dosage and duration:&lt;br&gt;                Lopinavir 400 mg + ritonavir 100 mg: by mouth (or nasogastric tube) every 12 hours for 10 days or unti",null,"&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Prolastin&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Powder and solvent for solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: HUMAN ALPHA1-PROTEINASE INHIBITOR&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 9041-92-3&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: HUMAN ALPHA1-PROTEINASE INHIBITOR&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;Route of administration of the placebo: Intravenous use&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Solnatide&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Powder for nebuliser suspension&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Solnatide&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 259206-53-06&lt;br&gt;Current Sponsor code: AP301&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: human tumour necrosis factor alpha-derived peptide Cys-Gly-Gln-Arg-Glu-Thr-Pro-Glu-Gly-Ala-Glu-Ala-Lys-Pro-Trp-Tyr-Cys&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg/ml milligram(s)/millilitre&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 25-&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Solvent for...&lt;br&gt;Route of administration of the placebo: Inhalation use&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;",null,"&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: RoActemraÂ®&lt;br&gt;Product Name: RoactemraÂ®&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: RoactemraÂ®&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 375823-41-9&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg/ml milligram(s)/millilitre&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 20-&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;Route of administration of the placebo: Intravenous use&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: ROACTEMRA&lt;br&gt;Product Name: tocilizumab&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Concentrate for solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 375823-41-9&lt;br&gt;Current Sponsor code: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 20-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","The administration of inhaled isoflurane for sedation, compared to intravenous sedation.

New interventions will only be added after submission to the appropriate approval bodies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                The PRINCIPLE trial will begin as a 1:1 randomised trial of usual care plus study-specific medication (in the first instance hydroxychloroquine) versus usual care alone but the study design has the capability to add additional interventions over time.

The Borg scale, of perceived effort, measures the entire range of effort that the individual perceives when exercising. This scale gives criteria to make adjustments to the intensity of exercise, that is, to the workload, and thus forecast and dictate the different intensities of exercise in sports and medical rehabilitation. The BS will be completed by patients at the beginning of each session, and after completing the exercise program, as well as at the end of the tests, every day (6MWT, 30STST). Patients will send the results of BS screenshot daily to the evaluator, via WhatsApp or email. ;hirty Seconds Sit-To-Stand Test (30STST). Evaluators will ask patients to place a straight-backed armless chair, with a hard seat , which will be stabilized by placing it against a wall, considering floor to seat height will be between 45 - 50 cm. Seated participants will asked to come forward on the seat until their feet will be flat on the floor, and to fold their upper limbs across the chest, without moving it during all test. Patients will be then instructed to stand up all the way and sit down once without using the upper limbs. Patients will start in the seated position on the chair and, upon command telematically, they will stand up, and then they will return to sitting as many times as they could, in a 30-second time period. The evaluators will control this test telematically by videoconference.;Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT).  The 6MWT will be performed by all patients in their home, under the telematically supervision of a physiotherapist. All patients will receive the same instructions before the walk, and will be encouraged by the physiotherapist who repeated set phrases every minute during the walk. The distance covered during the test will be recorded in meters telematically by patient smartphone.
