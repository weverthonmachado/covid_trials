In such a circumstance, the DMC will inform the Trial Steering Committee who will make the results available to the public and amend the trial arms accordingly.

The intervention consists of a rehabilitation intervention which focuses more on participation in usual activities and is offered via a coaching model to a virtual group of people. The intervention components are: identifying patient goals with therapist (1:1); and participation in virtual groups (up to 4 participants per session) with physiotherapist and occupational therapists which focus on increasing participation in life roles and usual activities. &lt;br&gt;The 1:1 session will last for approximately 45 minutes and will be followed by commencement of group sessions within 5 days.&lt;br&gt;Groups adopt a coaching model where the therapist talks about common challenges, facilitates discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas and the group brainstorm and plan next steps together. The group sessions will last approximately 45 minutes and will be delivered 3 times per week for up to 4 weeks. &lt;br&gt;Adherence will be measured using attendance logs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","Exposure to COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participant involvement is required, including but not limited to extra nasopharyngeal swabs, blood draws, as well as possible surveys (local site intervention is bound to ISARIC protocol).&lt;br&gt;There may be follow-up after discharge, at 3 and 6 month timepoints (protocol is evolving).","Mild:No;severe:No;","During routine daily laboratory rounds blood will be stored at -80 C until biomarkers will be assayed later.","Not applicable","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: PlaquenilÂ®&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Tablet&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Tablet&lt;br&gt;Route of administration of the placebo: Oral use&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Plaquenil&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Sulfate d'hydroxychloroquine&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Coated tablet&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 747-36-4&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: range&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 400-800&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: RoActemra&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Tocilizumab&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Tocilizumab&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 375823-41-9&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 400-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Roactemra&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Tocilizumab&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for injection in pre-filled pen&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Tocilizumab&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 375823-41-9&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 162-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Kevzara&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Sarilumab&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for injection in pre-filled pen&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: SARILUMAB&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: Kevzara&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 200-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Kineret&lt;br&gt;Product Name: Kineret&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: ANAKINRA&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 143090-92-0&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 100-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: RoActemra&lt;br&gt;Product Name: RoActemra&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Concentrate for solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 375823-41-9&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg/ml milligram(s)/millilitre&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 20-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: RoActemra&lt;br&gt;Product Name: RoActemra&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 375823-41-9&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive name: TOCILIZUMAB&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 162-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: SYLVANT&lt;br&gt;Product Name: SYLVANT&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Siltuximab&lt;br&gt;CAS Number: 541502-14-1&lt;br&gt;Concentration unit: mg milligram(s)&lt;br&gt;Concentration type: equal&lt;br&gt;Concentration number: 400-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","Based on preclinical and non-randomised studies, the Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital Intensive Care Unit clinical Consultant Medical Staff, in agreement with the Infectious Diseases Department and the Pharmacy Department, have decided that all patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 infection should receive hydroxychloroquine as standard care. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed. Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team. Blood samples will be transported to Queensland Pathology on the Herston Campus for drug analysis. Prescribing of initial and ongoing/revised dosing will remain the responsibility of medical officers, whilst fidelity of the intervention will be maintained through pharmacy dosing adjustment notes which are subjected to","Patients with pulmonary infection and COVID 19 will have their respiratory management during ICU admission decided in one of two ways&lt;br&gt;Method 1.

The treatment will be different in every patient. Depending on the results of the auscultation and waveform analysis, a different method of mechanical ventilation or respiratory physiotherapy may be chosen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Respiratory physiotherapy may be different in each case but will consist of either ventilator hyperinflation, positioning or manual techniques. The senior respiratory physiotherapist will decide the type of physiotherapy treatment delivered based on COVI 19 guidelines. &lt;br&gt;This will be from admission to ICU to 28 days post hospital
