The intervention components are: identifying patient goals with therapist (1:1); and participation in virtual groups (up to 4 participants per session) with physiotherapist and occupational therapists which focus on increasing participation in life roles and usual activities. &lt;br&gt;The 1:1 session will last for approximately 45 minutes and will be followed by commencement of group sessions within 5 days.&lt;br&gt;Groups adopt a coaching model where the therapist talks about common challenges, facilitates discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas and the group brainstorm and plan next steps together.

Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed. Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team. Blood samples will be transported to Queensland Pathology on the Herston Campus for drug analysis.

Based on this structure a questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire contains items that are only given once (e.g. items relating to the beginning of the pandemic) and items that can be given weekly. This questionnaire was checked for comprehensibility by 3 - 5 family doctors. The recruitment of the participants is carried out via the email distribution list of professional associations and existing family doctor research and teaching networks. The survey is conducted via the open source online tool LimeSurvey. Persons who have agreed to participate in a weekly survey in the first survey will be contacted weekly. Since each participant chooses a code that only he/she knows, it is possible to summarize the surveys belonging to one person longitudinally, but it is not possible to assign these answers to a specific person. This guarantees the anonymity of the respondents. &lt;br&gt;Evaluation: The questionnaire is evaluated descriptively. Primarily, the extent of existing deficiencies and problems is to be recognized. Therefore, the items are evaluated individually and no summary of the items is planned. For this reason, the answers are displayed in frequencies. In order to obtain a conclusion on the population, 95% confidence intervals are calculated for the frequencies. Possible group differences (e.g. ordination in the country vs. ordination in the city) are analysed exploratively by means of chi-square methods. The sample size results from the e-mail addresses available in the distribution lists.","Intervention 1: patients with painful polyneuropathy&lt;br&gt;Evaluation of questionnaires (DN4, BPI, PainDETECT, PROMIS, EuroQol 5D, Pain catastrophizing scale, IPAQ, PGIC)","Intervention 1: Patients with suspected COVID19 will be asked for medical history and current medication and a biomarker profile will be generated.
