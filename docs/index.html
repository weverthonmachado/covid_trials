Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed. Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team. Blood samples will be transported to Queensland Pathology on the Herston Campus for drug analysis. Prescribing of initial and ongoing/revised dosing will remain the responsibility of medical officers, whilst fidelity of the intervention will be maintained through pharmacy dosing adjustment notes

The Decathlon mask will be applied by clinicians in the hospital setting.&lt;br&gt;The mask is worn over the entire face and has advantages over conventional delivery methods in that it is thought to reduce the risk of virus aerosolization (a common problem with conventional delivery systems) and therefore increase safety for healthcare workers and other patients at the hospital.&lt;br&gt;We will test mask comfort and tolerability with daily questionnaires.&lt;br&gt;The mask will be applied to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during transfer between the emergency department and other locations such as radiology department, ward and high dependency unit.&lt;br&gt;We anticipate the mask will be worn for several hours at a time depending on patient tolerability (early data from overseas suggests superior tolerability to conventional mask setups).  The mask may be used intermittently for the entire patient admission to hospital pending the clinical needs and preference of the patient. We anticipate, based on how conventional treatments are applied, that the patient will use the mask in 3 hour sessions with potential breaks in between to be determined by clinical need and patient tolerability.","Drug: Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate (HCQ)","Drug: Spironolactone 100mg;Drug: Placebo oral tablet","Drug: Transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma","Diagnostic Test: Cytokines dosage;Diagnostic Test: Complement dosage","Procedure: Standard therapy recommended by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.;Procedure: Standard therapy recommended by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and Dalargin intramuscular injection;Procedure: Standard therapy recommended by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and Dalargin inhalation;Procedure: Standard therapy recommended by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and Dalargin intramuscular injection combined with Dalargin inhalation","Other: Telerehabilitation;Other: exercise brochure","Drug: Hydroxychloroquine;Drug: Placebo oral tablet","Behavioral: Video based exercise","Drug: Acalabrutinib","Intervention is an aqueous buffered solution of 0.5% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) contained in a 30 mL bottle closed with a traditional nasal spray pump.&lt;br&gt;Subjects will receive a single dose to their nasal passages, administered by the investigator. &lt;br&gt;The amount a subject receives consists of 6 x 140ÂµL pump actuations (3 into each nostril), being 0.84 mL total volume.","Drug: Tocilizumab","Other: Standard interface;Device: Double-Trunk Mask","Drug: Suspension of heat killed (autoclaved) Mycobacterium w;Drug: Standard therapy of COVID-19","Drug: Honey;Drug: Nigella Sativa / Black Cumin;Drug: Placebos","Two groups:modified respirator versus conventional respirator;","Drug: Favipiravir;Other: Standard of care treatment","Procedure: Prone Positioning;Procedure: Standard of care.","Drug: Defibrotide 25 mg/kg 24 hours continuous infusion for 15 days;Drug: Placebo 250 cc 24 hours continuous infusion for 15 days","Other: Saline Nasal Irrigation;Other: Saline with Baby Shampoo Nasal Irrigation","Drug: Dexamethasone and Hydroxychloroquine;Drug: Hydroxychloroquine","1.5ATA:1.5ATA HBO;2.5ATA:2.5ATA HBO;Control group:Routine treatment;","Drug: Allogeneic and expanded adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells","Drug: Ruxolitinib","Drug: Clazakizumab","Drug: favipiravir;Drug: Standard of care therapy","Drug: T3 solution for injection;Drug: Placebo","Drug: Ruxolitinib plus simvastatin;Other: Standard of Care","Diagnostic Test: COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Testing, mobile device image capture and telemedicine support;Other: Telemedicine","Other: Antibody-Rich Plasma from COVID-19 recovered patients","Drug: Hydroxychloroquine","Drug: Umifenovir;Drug: Interferon-ß 1a;Drug: Lopinavir / Ritonavir;Drug: Single Dose of Hydroxychloroquine;Drug: Standards of Care","experimental group:''Guangdong Pneumonia NO.1''+basic treatment;\t control group:basic treatment and(or) antiviral therapy;","Drug: Chloroquine;Drug: Placebo oral tablet","Drug: Interferon Beta-1A;Drug: Lopinavir / Ritonavir;Drug: Single Dose of Hydroxychloroquine","Drug: Selinexor;Other: Placebo","Drug: Gimsilumab;Drug: Placebo","Dietary Supplement: Ayurveda;Other: Usual Care","Drug: Dapagliflozin 10 MG;Drug: Placebo","Drug: Favipiravir;Drug: Placebos","Drug: Chloroquine;Drug: Nitazoxanide;Drug: Ivermectin","Routine treatment + Lianhua Qingwen Capsules/granules:4 capsules / time or 1 bag / time, 3 times a day;Conventional treatment:Treat as prescribed in the fourth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, without using traditional Chinese medicine;","Dietary Supplement: Zinc gluconate;Dietary Supplement: 25-OH cholecalciferol","Drug: Amiodarone;Drug: Verapamil","Drug: Nafamostat Mesilate;Drug: Placebo","Routine treatment + Lianhua Qingwen Capsules/granules:4 capsules / time or 1 bag / time, 3 times a day;Conventional treatment:Treat as prescribed in the fourth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan;","Biological: Autologous Adipose MSC's","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Dolquine 200 mg comprimidos recubiertos.&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Coated tablet&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Tablet&lt;br&gt;Route of administration of the placebo: Buccal use&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: azitromicina cinfa 500 mg comprimidos&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Capsule&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Kaletra&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Capsule&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","Drug: Enoxaparin Prefilled Syringe [Lovenox]","Drug: Hydroxychloroquine - Daily dosing;Drug: Hydroxychloroquine - Weekly Dosing;Other: Matched Placebo Hydroxychloroquine","Device: mouthrinse with bêta-cyclodextrin and citrox;Device: mouthrinse without bêta-cyclodextrin and citrox","Drug: HCQ &amp;

The group will allow members to receive information and contribute to weekly conversations on pre-specified topics related to physical activity eg. sedentary behaviour, goal setting, benefits of physical activity and support. Different topics will be covered each week with 2-3 Facebook posts on the topic each week. The content of each topic is designed specifically for this study but will also make use of existing videos, pictures and information sources. An exercise physiologists and dietitian will deliver the program. The purpose of the Facebook group is to facilitate social support and provide participants with a platform to exchange personal experiences including barriers and facilitators to commencing and maintaining a physical activity program. While discussion topics will be pre-determined, discussion will change weekly based on the participants posts for example someone may ask for examples of workouts or different ways overcome barriers. Participants will also be able to join a group video call via zoom two times per week. These calls will last for 20-30mins. The facilitator will lead the call and provide education on the topic for the week. This will also give the facilitator the chance to check in on participants and allow them to ask questions. The intervention itself will go for 6 weeks however there is the option for participants to remain in the Facebook group and continue to use it for support without the input from the facilitators. All 20 participants will be included in the one Facebook group and encouraged to check the Facebook weekly.

This non-invasive device provides a physical barrier to droplet and aerosol spread, as well as utilising a ventilation system to reduce aerosol spread from COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.  The hood has a skirt that drapes down the sides of the bed and over the patients waist and does not seal around the patient. The hood relies upon air being drawn up the sides of the bed and from the front near the patient’s legs etc. up to the rear, i.e. away from the healthcare worker who is principally at the front/sides of the patient. The air passes through the fan and on through a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, thereafter returning to the hospital air environment.  The device will be used continuously for 7 days or until the patient has been declared COVID-19 negative, is discharged from hospital, or elects to withdraw from the study.  Use of the device is entirely voluntary, and patients may elect to cease use of the device at any time either temporarily, or permanently.  Staff will be asked to complete simple data for each clinical shift about device compliance use.  In addition, measures to capture technical product adverse events and complaints will be captured by forms available to clinical staff and checked daily by the investigator team.  Technical product complaint data will be submitted to an independent data safety monitor team.","Drug: Sirolimus 1 MG/ML;Drug: Placebo","Drug: Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin;Dietary Supplement: Azinc","Biological: avdoralimab;Other: Placebo","Drug: SnPP Protoporphyrin;Drug: SnPP Protoporphyrin;Drug: SnPP Protoporphyrin;Drug: SnPP Protoporphyrin;Drug: SnPP Protoporphyrin;Drug: SnPP Protoporphyrin;Drug: Sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin;Drug: Sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin","Biological: Remestemcel-L®;Drug: Placebo","Other: blood sample","Other: Online questionnaire","Drug: Oseltamivir;Drug: hormones;Device: oxygen therapy;Procedure: mesenchymal stem cells","HDIVC group:100mg/kg/day;Control group:normal saline;","Other: Standard of care (SOC);Drug: Hydroxychloroquine;Drug: Association of diltiazem and niclosamide","The app includes seven modules that can be completed within a week to learn evidence-based coping skills based on CBT, psychoeducation and positive psychology techniques.

The app uses short videos and interactive activities to allow participants to practice the coping strategies that are taught in each module (e.g. a relaxation technique). Participants are asked to complete one module per day and to complete the modules in one week. Each module takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will be asked to complete module 1 first, but the other modules can be completed in any order.

Patients then enter the results into the TCC-COVID app twice daily, and complete a symptom questionnaire via the TCC-COVID app once daily, which will take approximately 5 minutes. The symptom questionnaire was designed specifically for this study. The measurements and information are directly connected to a clinician interface (KIOLA database) which provides the data of all patients in aggregate and an easy to use responsive format with customisable alerts. The alerts identify if the oxygen saturation levels are low or the pulse rate is out of range. The alerts also identify if a measurement has not been completed in a timely manner and the central monitoring service will contact the patient to check on their safety or if they are experiencing any technical issues.
