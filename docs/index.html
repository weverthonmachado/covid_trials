Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed.

The group will allow members to receive information and contribute to weekly conversations on pre-specified topics related to physical activity eg. sedentary behaviour, goal setting, benefits of physical activity and support. Different topics will be covered each week with 2-3 Facebook posts on the topic each week. The content of each topic is designed specifically for this study but will also make use of existing videos, pictures and information sources. An exercise physiologists and dietitian will deliver the program. The purpose of the Facebook group is to facilitate social support and provide participants with a platform to exchange personal experiences including barriers and facilitators to commencing and maintaining a physical activity program. While discussion topics will be pre-determined, discussion will change weekly based on the participants posts for example someone may ask for examples of workouts or different ways overcome barriers. Participants will also be able to join a group video call via zoom two times per week. These calls will last for 20-30mins. The facilitator will lead the call and provide education on the topic for the week. This will also give the facilitator the chance to check in on participants and allow them to ask questions. The intervention itself will go for 6 weeks however there is the option for participants to remain in the Facebook group and continue to use it for support without the input from the facilitators. All 20 participants will be included in the one Facebook group and encouraged to check the Facebook weekly.

The seven modules are: (1) identifying and rating emotions, (2) relaxation, (3) self-compassion, (4) gratitude, (5) staying connected, (6) physical care, and (7) goal setting. The app uses short videos and interactive activities to allow participants to practice the coping strategies that are taught in each module (e.g. a relaxation technique). Participants are asked to complete one module per day and to complete the modules in one week. Each module takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will be asked to complete module 1 first, but the other modules can be completed in any order.

The intervention consists of a rehabilitation intervention which focuses more on participation in usual activities and is offered via a coaching model to a virtual group of people. The intervention components are: identifying patient goals with therapist (1:1); and participation in virtual groups (up to 4 participants per session) with physiotherapist and occupational therapists which focus on increasing participation in life roles and usual activities. &lt;br&gt;The 1:1 session will last for approximately 45 minutes and will be followed by commencement of group sessions within 5 days.&lt;br&gt;Groups adopt a coaching model where the therapist talks about common challenges, facilitates discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas and the group brainstorm and plan next steps together. The group sessions will last approximately 45 minutes and will be delivered 3 times per week for up to 4 weeks. &lt;br&gt;Adherence will be measured using attendance logs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","'Anchored' is a smartphone application-based intervention that includes therapeutic content centred on behavioural activation (BA), mindfulness, and cognitive behavioural tasks. It was adapted from HeadGear, an existing smartphone application designed for individuals working in male-dominated industries. Anchored is more broadly aimed at all adults, and has a more gender-neutral look and feel, achieved through use of colour scheme, imagery, font/typography, inclusion of male and female â€˜charactersâ€™, and delivery of in-app content by both male and female presenters. The Anchored app is designed for self-directed use by an individual on a smartphone device. It features interactive content, delivered by on-screen text, audio, static and interactive image displays and videos. The app can be accessed by the participant on their smartphone at a time and location of their choosing. This app/intervention has been used previously in a pilot study: Pilot-testing of a mobile phone application to support the mental health of Australian workers (ACTRN12619000761167); and is being currently being evaluated in a large scale randomised controlled trial (ACTRN12620000178943). Due to the unexpected changes to the workforce brought about by COVID-19 (coronavirus) the present study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the Anchored app in individuals who are unemployed as a consequence of COVID-19. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main therapeutic component of the Anchored app takes the form of a 30 day intervention in which users complete one â€˜challengeâ€™ daily (5- 10 minutes per day).

Eligible patients are randomly allocated between several treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital: No additional treatment vs lopinavir + ritonavir vs corticosteroids vs hydroxychloroquine vs azithromycin. The study allows a second randomisation for patients with progressive COVID-19 (evidence of hypoxia and a hyper-inflammatory state): No additional treatment vs Tocilizumab. For patients for whom not all the trial arms are appropriate or at locations where not all are available, randomisation will be between fewer arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                RECOVERY has an adaptive trial design.

Patients then enter the results into the TCC-COVID app twice daily, and complete a symptom questionnaire via the TCC-COVID app once daily, which will take approximately 5 minutes. The symptom questionnaire was designed specifically for this study. The measurements and information are directly connected to a clinician interface (KIOLA database) which provides the data of all patients in aggregate and an easy to use responsive format with customisable alerts. The alerts identify if the oxygen saturation levels are low or the pulse rate is out of range. The alerts also identify if a measurement has not been completed in a timely manner and the central monitoring service will contact the patient to check on their safety or if they are experiencing any technical issues. The overall duration of participation will be 14 days.","severe group:high dose intravenous vitamin C;critical group:high dose intravenous vitamin C;","common type :Immunotherapy with recombinant chimeric DC vaccine;Latent period group:Immunotherapy with recombinant chimeric DC vaccine;Normal control group:Immunotherapy with recombinant chimeric DC vaccine;Blank vaccine control group:0.9%NS;","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Plaquenil 200mg&lt;br&gt;Product Name: hydroxychloroquine&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Coated tablet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Azithromycine&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Coated tablet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;","BCG-vaccine","Three conditions are tested (each lasting 30 min, the â€˜measurement periodâ€™): &lt;br&gt;1.

The Decathlon mask will be applied by clinicians in the hospital setting.&lt;br&gt;The mask is worn over the entire face and has advantages over conventional delivery methods in that it is thought to reduce the risk of virus aerosolization (a common problem with conventional delivery systems) and therefore increase safety for healthcare workers and other patients at the hospital.&lt;br&gt;We will test mask comfort and tolerability with daily questionnaires.&lt;br&gt;The mask will be applied to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during transfer between the emergency department and other locations such as radiology department, ward and high dependency unit.&lt;br&gt;We anticipate the mask will be worn for several hours at a time depending on patient tolerability (early data from overseas suggests superior tolerability to conventional mask setups).  The mask may be used intermittently for the entire patient admission to hospital pending the clinical needs and preference of the patient. We anticipate, based on how conventional treatments are applied, that the patient will use the mask in 3 hour sessions with potential breaks in between to be determined by clinical need and patient tolerability.","&lt;br&gt;Trade Name: Flebogamma 5% DIF&lt;br&gt;Pharmaceutical Form: Solution for infusion&lt;br&gt;INN or Proposed INN: Human normal immunoglobulin (IVIg)&lt;br&gt;Other descriptive

This non-invasive device provides a physical barrier to droplet and aerosol spread, as well as utilising a ventilation system to reduce aerosol spread from COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.  The hood has a skirt that drapes down the sides of the bed and over the patients waist and does not seal around the patient. The hood relies upon air being drawn up the sides of the bed and from the front near the patient’s legs etc. up to the rear, i.e. away from the healthcare worker who is principally at the front/sides of the patient. The air passes through the fan and on through a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, thereafter returning to the hospital air environment.  The device will be used continuously for 7 days or until the patient has been declared COVID-19 negative, is discharged from hospital, or elects to withdraw from the study.  Use of the device is entirely voluntary, and patients may elect to cease use of the device at any time either temporarily, or permanently.  Staff will be asked to complete simple data for each clinical shift about device compliance use.  In addition, measures to capture technical product adverse events and complaints will be captured by forms available to clinical staff and checked daily by the investigator team.  Technical product complaint data will be submitted to an independent data safety monitor team.","HDIVC group:100mg/kg/day;Control group:normal saline;","Control  group:xiaoyao capsule;Experimental group:xiaoyao capsule;","Group 2:Conventional treatment;Group 2:Conventional treatment plus liu-zi--jue exercisee therapy;","Intervention group:Lingnan Fire-Needle Therapy;Control:Health and life guidance;","Group 2:Aliskiren with Standard Care;Group 1:Nifedipine with Standard Care;","Experimental group:Jiexingjunzi granules ;control group:placebo;","Experimental group:Basic treatment + kolimycin;Control group:Basic treatment;","&lt;br&gt;                The trial will initially be two-arm, comparing usual care to usual care with hydroxychloroquine treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                The trial will be implemented in the first instance in practices that are already part of the RCGP RSC Network.
